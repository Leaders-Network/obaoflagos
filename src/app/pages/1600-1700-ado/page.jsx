                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Oba Ado, historically recognized as the first Oba of Lagos, was a
              pivotal figure in the establishment of the Lagos monarchy. He was
              one of the children of the Oba of Benin and is believed to have
              migrated from the Benin Kingdom to the Lagos area in the early
              17th century. His journey was part of the broader expansion of
              Benin's influence along the coastal regions of present-day
              Nigeria.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-lg">
                  Ado's migration to Lagos (then known as Eko) was strategic, aligning with the Benin Kingdom's aspirations to establish a foothold in the area for trade and administrative purposes. The area was already inhabited by the Awori people, who were led by local chiefs but lacked centralized governance.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                  Upon arriving in Lagos, Ado was installed as a leader under the authority of the Oba of Benin. This marked the beginning of the Lagos monarchy. He is credited with introducing the structure and customs of Benin governance, which became the foundation of Lagos' political and cultural framework.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-lg">
                  Ado's leadership style helped unite the Awori communities and fostered stability. He successfully navigated local politics and established himself as the central authority figure. His reign signified the transition of Lagos from a collection of loosely governed settlements to a cohesive entity with centralized leadership.
